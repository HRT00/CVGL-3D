# SkyLink: Unifying Street-Satellite Geo-Localization via UAV-Mediated 3D Scene Alignment
Official implementation of 2025 ACM'MM UAV Challenging paper (https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/22073), TeamName: XMUSmart.

## News
🚩 **2025.07.07: Comming Soon! Codes will be released upon the paper's publicationd.**

🚩 **2025.07.24: Our paper has been accepted by ACM'MM 2025 UAVM.**

## Description 📜
This research mainly focus on ground-satellite geo-localization. We aims at robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation and propose the novel SkyLink method. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning.
