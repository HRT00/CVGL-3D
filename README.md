# SkyLink: Unifying Street-Satellite Geo-Localization via UAV-Mediated 3D Scene Alignment
Official implementation of 2025 ACM'MM UAV Challenging paper SkyLink (https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/22073), TeamName: XMUSmart.

## News
üö© **2025.07.07: Comming Soon! Codes will be released upon the paper's publicationd.**

üö© **2025.07.24: Our paper has been accepted by ACM'MM 2025 UAVM. The codes for training has been released!**

## Description üìú
This research mainly focus on ground-satellite geo-localization. We aims at robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation and propose the novel SkyLink method. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning.

## Framework üñáÔ∏è
<td style="text-align: center"><img src="./figures/overview.jpg" alt="Framework" width="850"></td>

## Requirements
### Installation
Create a conda environment and install dependencies:
```bash
conda create -n cvgl python=3.10
conda activate cvgl

# Install the according versions of torch and torchvision
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit
```

## Quick Start
To train SkyLink model, you can run the following command:
```
python train_universityMM.py
```
To test SkyLink model with test-time augmentation (TTA) in the competition, you can also run the command:
```
python test_mm_tta.py
```
We reconstruct the point-clouds from multi-view UAV images by VGGT model, you can refer to \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt}.
